# Bluespec_BSV_Tutorial
#My tutorial for learning the Bluespec BSV HLHDL (High Level Hardware
#Design Langauge)

#BSV is a High-level Hardware Design Language (HLHDL), taking its inspirations from Haskell and Term Rewriting Systems.
#A commercial implementation of BSV (a compiler from BSV into Verilog) has been available from
#Bluespec, Inc. (www.bluespec.com) since 2004, and has been used for several industrial-strength hardware designs.
